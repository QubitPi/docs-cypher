:description: Information about the expressions available in Cypher.
:page-aliases: syntax/operators.adoc

A Cypher expression is any part of a query that evaluates to a value.
For details and examples of specific expressions, see the following sections:

* xref:expressions/predicates/index.adoc[]
** xref:expressions/predicates/boolean-operators.adoc[]: `AND`, `OR`, `XOR`, `NOT`
** xref:expressions/predicates/comparison-operators.adoc[]: `=`, `<>`, `<`, `>`, `\<=`, `>=`, `IS NULL`, `IS NOT NULL`
** xref:expressions/predicates/list-operators.adoc[]: `IN`
** xref:expressions/predicates/string-operators.adoc[]: `STARTS WITH`, `ENDS WITH`, `CONTAINS`, `IS NORMALIZED`, `IS NOT NORMALIZED`, `=~`
** xref:expressions/predicates/path-pattern-expressions.adoc[]: information about filtering queries with path pattern expressions.
** xref:expressions/predicates/type-predicate-expressions.adoc[]: information about how to verify the value type of a Cypher expression.
* xref:expressions/node-relationship-operators.adoc[]: information about how to access `NODE` and `RELATIONSHIP` property values with `.` and `[]`.
* xref:expressions/mathematical-operators.adoc[]: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `^`.
* xref:expressions/string-operators.adoc[]: `+`, `||`
* xref:expressions/temporal-operators.adoc[]: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
* xref:expressions/list-expressions.adoc[]: information about list concatenation operators (`||`, `+`), list element access, list slicing, and list as well as pattern comprehensions.
* xref:expressions/map-expressions.adoc[]: information about map operators (`.`, `[]`) and map projection.
* xref:expressions/conditional-expressions.adoc[]

The following expressions are documented elsewhere in the Cypher Manual:

* xref:patterns/reference.adoc#label-expressions[Label expressions]
* xref:functions/index.adoc[Function calls]
* Subquery expressions: xref:subqueries/collect.adoc[`COLLECT`], xref:subqueries/count.adoc[`COUNT`], and xref:subqueries/existential.adoc[`EXISTS`]
* Value literals (see xref:values-and-types/index.adoc[])
* xref:values-and-types/graph-references.adoc[]

[NOTE]
Expressions containing unsanitized user input may make your application vulnerable to Cypher injection.
Consider using xref:syntax/parameters.adoc[parameters] instead.
