= Predicates
:Description: Overview of the predicate expressions in Cypher.

Predicates evaluate to a `BOOLEAN` value (`true`, `false`, or `null`), and are frequently used for filtering in xref:clauses/where.adoc[`WHERE`] subclauses.

This chapter is divided into the following sections:

* xref:expressions/predicates/boolean-operators.adoc[]: `AND`, `OR`, `XOR`, `NOT`
* xref:expressions/predicates/comparison-operators.adoc[]: `=`, `<>`, `<`, `>`, `\<=`, `>=`, `IS NULL`, `IS NOT NULL`
* xref:expressions/predicates/list-operators.adoc[]: `IN`
* xref:expressions/predicates/string-operators.adoc[]: `STARTS WITH`, `ENDS WITH`, `CONTAINS`, `IS NORMALIZED`, `IS NOT NORMALIZED`, `=~`
* xref:expressions/predicates/path-pattern-expressions.adoc[]: information about filtering queries with path pattern expressions.
* xref:expressions/predicates/type-predicate-expressions.adoc[]: information about how to verify the value type of a Cypher expression.

The following can also serve as a predicates if they result in a `BOOLEAN` value (but are documented elsewhere):

* xref:syntax/variables.adoc[]
* xref:queries/concepts.adoc[Properties] (See also xref:values-and-types/property-structural-constructed.adoc#property-types[Values and types -> property types])
* xref:functions/predicate.adoc[Predicate functions]
* xref:expressions/conditional-expressions.adoc[]
