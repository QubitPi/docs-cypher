= String operators
:description: Information about Cypher's predicate string operators.
:table-caption!:

String operators are used to perform operations on `STRING` values.
Cypher contains the following string operators:

* Prefix: `STARTS WITH` (case sensitive)
* Suffix: `ENDS WITH` (case sensitive)
* substring: `CONTAINS` (case sensitive)
* Regular expression: `=~`
* `IS NORMALIZED`
* `IS NOT NORMALIZED`

These operators perform _case-sensitive_ matching.
Attempting to use them on values which are not `STRING` values will return `NULL`.

The following graph is used for the examples below:

To recreate the graph, run the following query in an empty Neo4j database:

[source, cypher, role=test-setup]
----
CREATE (alice:Person {name:'Alice', age: 65, role: 'Project manager', email: 'alice@company.com'}),
       (cecil:Person {name: 'Cecil', age: 25, role: 'Software developer', email: 'cecil@private.se'}),
       (cecilia:Person {name: 'Cecilia', age: 31, role: 'Software developer'}),
       (charlie:Person {name: 'Charlie', age: 61, role: 'Security engineer'}),
       (daniel:Person {name: 'Daniel', age: 39, role: 'Director', email: 'daniel@company.com'}),
       (eskil:Person {name: 'Eskil', age: 39, role: 'CEO', email: 'eskil@company.com'})

[[regular-expressions]]
== Regular expressions

Cypher supports filtering using regular expressions.
The regular expression syntax is inherited from the link:https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/regex/Pattern.html[Java regular expressions].
This includes support for flags that change how `STRING` values are matched, including the case-insensitive `(?i)`, multiline `(?m)`, and dotall `(?s)` flags.
Flags are given at the beginning of the regular expression.

.Regular expressions
=====

.Regular expression (`=~`)
[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (n:Person)
WHERE n.email =~ '.*@company.com'
RETURN n.name AS name, n.email AS email
----

.Result
[role="queryresult",options="header,footer",cols="2*<m"]
|===
| name | email

| "Alice" | "alice@company.com"
| "Daniel" | "daniel@company.com"
| "Eskil" | "eskil@company.com"

2+d|Rows: 3
|===

By pre-pending a regular expression with the flag `(?i)`, the whole expression becomes case-insensitive:

.Case-insensitive regular expression `(?i)` 
[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (n:Person)
WHERE n.name =~ '(?i)CEC.*'
RETURN n.name
----

The names of both `Cecil` and `Cecilia` are returned because their name starts with `'CEC'` regardless of casing:

.Result
[role="queryresult",options="header,footer",cols="1*<m"]
|===
| name

| "Cecil"
| "Cecilia"

[[escaping-in-regular-expressions]]
=== Escaping in regular expressions

Characters such as `.` or `*` have special meaning in a regular expression.
To use these as ordinary characters without special meaning, escape them.

.Escaped characters in a regular expression
[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (n:Person)
WHERE n.email =~ '.*\\.se'
RETURN n.name AS name, n.email AS email
----

`Cecil` is returned because his email ends with `'.se'`:

.Result
[role="queryresult",options="header,footer",cols="2*<m"]
|===
| name | email

| "Cecil" | "cecil@private.se"

2+d|Rows: 1

|===

Note that the regular expression constructs in
link:https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/regex/Pattern.html[Java regular expressions] are applied only after resolving the escaped character sequences in the given xref::values-and-types/boolean-numeric-string.adoc#string[string literal].
It is sometimes necessary to add additional backslashes to express regular expression constructs.
This list clarifies the combination of these two definitions, containing the original escape sequence and the resulting character in the regular expression:

[options="header", cols=">1,<2,<2"]
|===
|String literal sequence|Resulting Regex sequence|Regex match
|`\t`|Tab|Tab
|`\\t`|`\t`|Tab
|`\b`|Backspace|Backspace
|`\\b`|`\b`|Word boundary
|`\n`|Newline|NewLine
|`\\n`|`\n`|Newline
|`\r`|Carriage return|Carriage return
|`\\r`|`\r`|Carriage return
|`\f`|Form feed|Form feed
|`\\f`|`\f`|Form feed
|`\'`|Single quote|Single quote
|`\"`|Double quote|Double quote
|`\\`|Backslash|Backslash
|`\\\`|`\\`|Backslash
|`\uxxxx`|Unicode UTF-16 code point (4 hex digits must follow the `\u`)|Unicode UTF-16 code point (4 hex digits must follow the `\u`)
|`\\uxxxx`|`\uxxxx`|Unicode UTF-16 code point (4 hex digits must follow the `\u`)

[NOTE]
====
Using regular expressions with unsanitized user input makes you vulnerable to Cypher injection.
Consider using xref:syntax/parameters.adoc[parameters] instead.

[[string-normalization-operators]]
== String normalization operators

The `IS NORMALIZED` operator is used to check whether the given `STRING` is in the `NFC` Unicode normalization form:

[NOTE]
====
Unicode normalization is a process that transforms different representations of the same string into a standardized form.
For more information, see the documentation for link:https://unicode.org/reports/tr15/#Norm_Forms[Unicode normalization forms].
====

.`IS NORMALIZED` operator
[source, cypher]
----
RETURN 'the \u212B char' IS NORMALIZED AS normalized
----

.Result
[role="queryresult",options="header,footer",cols="1*<m"]
|===
| normalized
| FALSE

1+|Rows: 1
|===

Because the given `STRING` contains a non-normalized Unicode character (`\u212B`), `FALSE` is returned.

To normalize a `STRING`, use the xref:functions/string.adoc#functions-normalize[normalize()] function.

Note that the `IS NORMALIZED` operator returns `NULL` when used on a non-`STRING` value.
For example, `RETURN 1 IS NORMALIZED` returns `NULL`.

The `IS NOT NORMALIZED` operator is used to check whether the given `STRING` is not in the `NFC` Unicode normalization form:

.`IS NOT NORMALIZED`
[source, cypher]
----
RETURN 'the \u212B char' IS NOT NORMALIZED AS notNormalized
----

.Result
[role="queryresult",options="header,footer",cols="1*<m"]
|===
| notNormalized
| TRUE

1+|Rows: 1
|===

Because the given `STRING` contains a non-normalized Unicode character (`\u212B`), and is not normalized, `TRUE` is returned.

Note that the `IS NOT NORMALIZED` operator returns `NULL` when used on a non-`STRING` value.
For example, `RETURN 1 IS NOT NORMALIZED` returns `NULL`.


[[defining-normalization-forms]]
=== Using `IS NORMALIZED` with a specified normalization type

It is possible to define which Unicode normalization type is used (the default is `NFC`).

The available normalization types are:

* `NFC`
* `NFD`
* `NFKC`
* `NFKD`

.Query
[source, cypher]
----
WITH 'the \u00E4 char' as myString
RETURN myString IS NFC NORMALIZED AS nfcNormalized,
    myString IS NFD NORMALIZED AS nfdNormalized
----

The given `STRING` contains the Unicode character: `\u00E4`, which is considered normalized in `NFC` form, but not in `NFD` form.

.Result
[role="queryresult",options="header,footer",cols="2*<m"]
|===
| nfcNormalized | nfdNormalized
| TRUE          | FALSE
2+|Rows: 2
|===

It is also possible to specify the normalization form when using the negated normalization operator.
For example, `RETURN "string" IS NOT NFD NORMALIZED`.
