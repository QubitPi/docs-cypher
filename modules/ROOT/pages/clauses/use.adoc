= USE
:description: The `USE` clause determines which graph a query, or query part, is executed against.


The `USE` clause determines which graph a query, or query part, is executed against.
It is supported for queries and schema commands.


[[query-use-syntax]]
== Syntax

[source, syntax, role="noheader"]
----
USE <graph reference>
<other clauses>
----

A graph reference can be described using:

* Direct graph references: `USE db1`.
* The graph function xref:functions/graph.adoc#functions-graph-by-elementid[`graph.byElementId()`], to access a graph of a given element: `USE graph.byName(<element-id-string>)`.

When connected to a composite database, a graph reference may additionally be passed with:

* The graph function xref:functions/graph.adoc#functions-graph-byname[`graph.byName()`], which allows the graph reference to be resolved dynamically: `USE graph.byName(<string-expression>)`.

A more detailed description of how and when a graph references needs to be quoted and/or escaped is defined xref::values-and-types/graph-references.adoc#rules[here].

== USE clause when connected to a standard or system database

All databases and aliases are valid graph reference targets except link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/operations-manual/current/database-administration/aliases/manage-aliases-composite-databases/[composite databases and their constituents].
Targeting multiple databases is not allowed, unless connected to a composite database.

=== Position of use clauses
When connected to a non-composite database, the `USE` clause can only appear as the prefix of schema commands, or as the first clause of queries. There may be multiple `USE` clauses as long as they target the same database.

== USE clause when connected to a composite database
When executing queries against a link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/operations-manual/current/database-administration/composite-databases/concepts/[composite database], the `USE` clause must only refer to graphs that are part of the current composite database. The constituents can be listed either with `RETURN graph.names()` when connected to the composite database or `SHOW DATABASES YIELD name, constituents RETURN *`.

=== Position of use clauses
When running queries against a composite database, the `USE` clause can appear as the first clause of:

* A query (similar to how it is used when connected to a non-composite database).
* Union parts:
+
[source, syntax, role="noheader"]
----
USE <graph>
<other clauses>
  UNION
USE <graph>
<other clauses>
----

* Subqueries:
+
[source, syntax, role="noheader"]
----
CALL () {
  USE <graph>
  <other clauses>
}
----
+
In subqueries, a `USE` clause may appear directly following the xref:subqueries/call-subquery.adoc#variable-scope-clause[variable scope clause]: `CALL () { ... }`.


[[query-use-examples]]
== Examples

////
[source, cypher, role=test-setup]
----
CREATE DATABASE myDatabase;
CREATE COMPOSITE DATABASE `myComposite`;
CREATE ALIAS `myComposite`.`myConstituent` FOR DATABASE `myDatabase`;
----
////

[[query-use-examples-query-graph]]
=== Query a graph

This example assumes that the DBMS contains a database named `myDatabase`:

.Query
// tag::clauses_use[]
[source, cypher]
----
USE myDatabase
MATCH (n) RETURN n
----
// end::clauses_use[]

[[query-use-examples-query-composite-database-constituent-graph]]
=== Query a composite database constituent graph

In this example it is assumed that the DBMS contains a composite database named `myComposite`, which includes an alias named `myConstituent`:

.Query
// tag::clauses_use_composite[]
[source, cypher]
----
USE myComposite.myConstituent
MATCH (n) RETURN n
----
// end::clauses_use_composite[]


[[query-use-examples-query-composite-database-constituent-graph-dynamically]]
=== Query a composite database constituent graph dynamically

The xref:functions/graph.adoc#functions-graph-byname[`graph.byName()`] function can be used in the `USE` clause to resolve a constituent graph from a `STRING` value containing the qualified name of a constituent.

This example uses a composite database named `myComposite` that includes an alias named `myConstituent`:

.Query
[source, cypher]
----
USE graph.byName('myComposite.myConstituent')
MATCH (n) RETURN n
----

The argument can be any expression that evaluates to the name of a constituent graph - for example a parameter:

// can't run this through drivers, we need a value when initializing a session
.Query
[source, cypher, role=test-skip]
----
USE graph.byName($graphName)
MATCH (n) RETURN n
----

[[query-use-examples-query-composite-database-by-element-id]]
=== Query a composite database constituent using elementId

The xref:functions/graph.adoc#functions-graph-by-elementid[`graph.byElementId()`] function can be used in the `USE` clause to resolve a constituent graph to which a given xref:functions/scalar.adoc#functions-elementid[element id] belongs.

In the below example, it is assumed that the DBMS contains the database corresponding to the given element id. If you are connected to a composite database it needs to be a element id to a constituent database, which is a standard database in the DBMS.

.Query
[source, cypher, role=test-skip]
----
USE graph.byElementId("4:c0a65d96-4993-4b0c-b036-e7ebd9174905:0")
MATCH (n) RETURN n
----
