:description: Overview about how to use `UNION` and `WHEN` to construct combined or conditional queries in Cypher.

`UNION`, `WHEN` and `NEXT` enable the composition of multiple separate query branches within a single query.
`UNION` allows for combining the results of different queries.
`WHEN` enables conditional queries, where different query branches can be made to execute depending on a set of criteria.
Finally, `NEXT` allows for the linear composition of sequential queries, passing the return values from one query to the next.
As such, `UNION`, `WHEN`, and `NEXT` manage in different ways the execution flow and logic of queries and cannot be used in queries as regular clauses.
