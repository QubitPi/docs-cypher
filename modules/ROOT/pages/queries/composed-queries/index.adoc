:description: Overview about how to use `UNION` and `WHEN` to construct combined or conditional queries in Cypher.

`UNION` and `WHEN` enable the composition of multiple separate query branches within a single query.
`UNION` allows for combining the results of different queries, while `WHEN` enables conditional queries, where different query branches can be made to execute depending on a set of criteria.
As such, `UNION` and `WHEN` manage in different ways the execution flow and logic of queries and cannot be used in queries as regular clauses.
