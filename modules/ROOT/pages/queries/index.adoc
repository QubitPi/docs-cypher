= Queries
:description: This page is an overview of the queries section in the Cypher Manual.

This section provides a brief overview of the core concepts of a Cypher query (nodes, relationships, and paths), along with examples of how to query a Neo4j graph database.
It also explains how to select the version of Cypher in which queries are run, and how to compose combined queries using `UNION`, conditional queries using `WHEN`, and sequential queries using `NEXT`.
